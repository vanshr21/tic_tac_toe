# Tic Tac Toe in Java

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using two files: Main.java and Cls.java.
<br/>
<q>Cls file contain code to clear the command line.</q>
<br/>
<b>Run this code only on cmd for better result.</b>
<h2><b><u>New feature</u></b></h2>
<p>I removed the draw functionality from the game and add a new one, this allow the game to remove the most earliest input after the 7 inputs to make the game going on unless a winner is found.</p>

## How to Run
